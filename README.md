- In Visual Studio Code open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).
- Search for and select `Python: Create Environment`.
- Select Venv, select your Python Version, and then select requirements.txt.
- Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- I would recommend the Windows (x86, 64-bit), MSI Installer for each of the following:
    - Make sure you have MySQL Server downloaded (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/). 
    - Make sure that you have MySQL Workbench downloaded (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) 
- Insstall eacn and when you set up MySQL Workbench make sure you remember what password you use.
- Then in the root directory make a file and name it `.env` and add your enviornment variabls
    - (i.e. USER, PASSWORD, HOST, and PORT)
- Then run seed.py()
- You can then run app.py to get the server running.
